# LEDGER

This is an E-Commerce API, organized 
into distinct packages involving both backend and frontend
aspects. The controller package encapsulates the core
functionalities, featuring dedicated controller classes for
essential components such as configurations, models,
data and the Ledger Application. Each controller class handles
specific operations related to its domain. The MySQL package
houses DAO (Data Access Object) classes that interact with
the underlying MySQL database and each are responsible for
database operations related to categories, products,
profiles, and user entities, respectively.
